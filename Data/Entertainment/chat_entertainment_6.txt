Alex: Hey family! The Oscars are coming up next Sunday. Should we watch it together?

Mom: That sounds fun! It’s always exciting to see the red carpet looks.

Dad: Agreed. Which movies are nominated this year?

Alex: A lot of great ones! Oppenheimer, Barbie, Everything Everywhere All At Once, and more.

Sister: I’m rooting for Barbie! It was so fun and colorful.

Mom: I loved Oppenheimer. The storytelling was incredible.

Dad: I’m team Everything Everywhere All At Once. It was such a unique film.

Alex: Who’s hosting this year?

Mom: I think it’s Jimmy Kimmel again. He always has good jokes.

Sister: Do you remember when he did the bit about La La Land and Moonlight? That was wild.

Dad: What’s everyone’s pick for Best Actor?

Alex: Cillian Murphy for Oppenheimer. His performance was phenomenal.

Mom: I agree. He really carried that movie.

Sister: What about Best Actress? Margot Robbie in Barbie was so good.

Dad: She was great, but I think Michelle Yeoh deserves it for Everything Everywhere All At Once.

Alex: Should we make it a themed night?

Mom: Ooh, yes! We could dress up like we’re on the red carpet.

Sister: Love it. I’ll go full glam with a sparkly dress.

Dad: I’ll stick to my tux. Simple and classic.

Alex: I’ll grab some Oscar trivia games to play during the commercials.

Mom: Sounds perfect. I’ll make some fancy finger foods.

Sister: And I’ll handle the desserts. Let’s make it a party!

Alex: Deal. This is going to be the best Oscars night ever!
