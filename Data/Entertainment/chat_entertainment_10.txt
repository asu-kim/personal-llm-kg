Alex: Hey everyone! Want to catch a movie this weekend?

Mia: Yes! What’s playing?

Jake: I’m in! Is there a specific movie you want to see?

Alex: How about Oppenheimer? I’ve been dying to watch it.

Liam: That’s a great choice. When were you thinking?

Alex: Saturday evening works for me after 6 PM.

Mia: Perfect! Let’s do the 7 PM show then.

Jake: Sounds good. Which theater?

Alex: The Grand Plaza. It’s close and has the best sound system.

Liam: Do we need to book tickets in advance?

Alex: Definitely. I’ll book them today.

Mia: Should we grab snacks before the movie?

Jake: Popcorn is a must. I’ll bring some candy.

Liam: I’ll get some drinks. What about dinner before?

Alex: Good idea! There’s a nice café near the theater.

Mia: Let’s meet there at 5 PM for dinner.

Jake: Do we want to do anything after the movie?

Alex: Maybe a quick coffee? There’s a late-night café nearby.

Liam: Perfect. This is going to be fun!

Mia: Can’t wait! I’ll bring a jacket—it’s always cold in the theater.

Jake: Good call. Don’t forget to share the booking details, Alex.

Alex: Will do. Looking forward to it!

Mia: Same here. See you all Saturday at 5 PM.

Liam: Movie night, here we come!
