Alex: Hey everyone! The Oscars are coming up next Sunday. Should we plan a watch party?
Mia: Yes! I’ve been waiting for this. Whose place are we doing it at?
Liam: How about Alex’s place? You’ve got the best setup for this.
Alex: Haha, sure. My place works. Let’s start around 7 PM, so we don’t miss the red carpet.
Zoe: Perfect! I’ll bring popcorn and chips. Any drink preferences?
Mia: I’m good with soda. Something fizzy to match the glam!
Liam: Can someone make sure there’s coffee? I don’t want to doze off during the speeches.
Alex: Coffee, soda, and snacks, noted. Should we make it a themed night?
Mia: Ooh, yes! Let’s dress up as our favorite movie characters from this year’s nominees.
Zoe: Love it. I’m coming as Barbie—pink all the way!
Liam: Then I’ll be Ken. But I’m not singing “Push.” 😅
Mia: Lol, I’ll go as one of the astronauts from Interstellar. Always classic!
Alex: Nice. I’ll be Oppenheimer. Suit and serious face included.
Zoe: This is going to be so much fun. What’s everyone’s pick for Best Picture?
Alex: Tough one, but I’m rooting for Oppenheimer. The visuals were stunning!
Mia: Same here. But I won’t be mad if Barbie wins.
Liam: I’m all in for Everything Everywhere All At Once. Such a creative masterpiece.
Zoe: Agree! It’s so unique. But my heart says Barbie.
Alex: Seems like we’re split. This will make the reactions even better!
Mia: Should we have a little ballot competition for the winners?
Alex: Great idea! I’ll print out ballots and we can make predictions before the show.
Liam: What’s the prize for the winner?
Zoe: Bragging rights, obviously. And maybe a chocolate Oscar?
Alex: Done. I’ll grab some chocolate trophies for the fun of it.
Mia: This sounds amazing. Can’t wait!
Zoe: Same. I’ll prep my Oscar night playlist to set the mood before the show.
Liam: Let’s do this! Best Oscar night ever, incoming.
Alex: Absolutely. See you all next Sunday at 7 PM!
