Alex: Hey guys, have you rewatched The Office lately? It never gets old!

Mill: Totally! Michael Scott is the best. His “World’s Best Boss” mug still cracks me up.

Tarter: Haha, yes! Remember the fire drill episode? Dwight was so chaotic.

Leo: Classic. “Stay calm! Everybody stay calm!” while everything was on fire.

Alex: What’s your favorite prank Jim pulled on Dwight?

Mill: The stapler in Jello. It’s so simple, yet so genius.

Tarter: For me, it’s when Jim convinced Dwight that he’d been recruited by the CIA.

Leo: Oh, the mega desk prank was amazing. Dwight’s face was priceless!

Alex: Do you guys think Pam and Jim are the best TV couple ever?

Mill: 100%. Their chemistry is unmatched.

Tarter: Agreed, though Michael and Holly are hilarious together.

Leo: True, but I’ll always root for Dwight and Angela. They’re secretly so sweet.

Alex: What’s the most awkward moment on the show for you?

Mill: The dinner party episode. Michael and Jan’s fight was so cringy.

Tarter: Oh yes, and when Phyllis got flashed during the charity 5K.

Leo: Scott’s Tots. That entire episode is painfully awkward!

Alex: Agreed. Who’s your favorite side character?

Mill: Creed. His one-liners are legendary.

Tarter: Kevin. That chili spill scene is unforgettable.

Leo: Stanley. His “Did I stutter?” moment is iconic.

Alex: If there were a reboot, would you guys watch it?

Mill: Absolutely, but only if the original cast is back.

Tarter: Same here. Nobody could replace Steve Carell as Michael.

Leo: Agreed. The Office is perfect as it is, though.

Alex: True. It’s hard to top such a masterpiece.
