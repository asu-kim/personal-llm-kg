Alex: Hey team! Who’s in for game night this Saturday?
Mia: Count me in! What’s the plan?
Liam: Same here. Are we meeting at your place, Alex?
Alex: Yup! My place at 7 PM. Let’s bring out all the board games this time.
Zoe: Awesome! I’ll bring Uno and Codenames. What about snacks?
Mia: I can bring some chips and dips. Any drink preferences?
Liam: I’ll grab some sodas and sparkling water. Should we do pizza for dinner?
Alex: Pizza is always a win. I’ll order a few varieties. Any specific requests?
Zoe: Pepperoni for sure! And maybe a veggie one for balance.
Mia: Sounds good. I’ll take care of dessert. Ice cream okay?
Alex: Perfect! We’re all set then. Any special games anyone wants to play?
Liam: Monopoly? Let’s see who survives the longest this time!
Zoe: Haha, I’ll try not to rage quit this time. Also, Jenga would be fun.
Mia: Great ideas. I can’t wait. Should we set a theme for the night?
Alex: Ooh, a theme sounds fun. How about “Retro”? Dress like the 80s or 90s?
Zoe: Love it! I have the perfect outfit for that.
Liam: Same here. Time to bring out my neon jackets!
Mia: This is going to be so cool. I’ll look up some retro music playlists.
Alex: Perfect! Retro vibes, board games, and snacks. See you all at 7 PM Saturday.
Zoe: Can’t wait! It’s going to be epic.
Mia: Totally! Best game night ever, here we come.
Liam: Let’s make it unforgettable. See you all then!
