Alex: Hey everyone! Who’s up for a tennis match this Saturday afternoon?

Mia: I’m in! What time were you thinking?

Jake: Count me in too. Is the court at the park available?

Alex: Yes, the court’s open from 4 PM. Let’s meet there.

Liam: Sounds good. Do we have all the equipment we need?

Alex: I’ve got two rackets and some tennis balls. Does anyone else have rackets?

Mia: I can bring one racket.

Jake: I’ve got another one, so we’re covered.

Liam: Perfect. Are we doing singles or doubles?

Alex: Let’s start with doubles and rotate teams.

Mia: Great idea. Should we keep score, or is it just for fun?

Alex: Let’s keep it casual and have fun.

Jake: What about snacks and drinks?

Alex: I’ll bring some water bottles and energy bars.

Mia: I’ll bring some fruit—maybe bananas and oranges.

Liam: I’ll grab some sports drinks for everyone.

Jake: Should we warm up first?

Alex: Definitely. Let’s do some stretches and practice volleys before starting.

Mia: What’s the plan if it rains?

Alex: We can reschedule or maybe play indoors at the rec center.

Liam: Sounds like a plan. Let’s hope the weather holds up.

Jake: Can’t wait. Tennis matches are always a blast!

Alex: Agreed. See you all at 4 PM on Saturday!
