Alex: Hey everyone! Want to go swimming this Sunday morning?

Mia: Sounds great! Where were you thinking?

Jake: Count me in! Is the community pool available?

Alex: Yes, I’ve checked, and the community pool is open from 9 AM.

Liam: Perfect. Should we bring anything?

Alex: Just your swimsuits, towels, and goggles if you have them.

Mia: I’ll bring some sunscreen and a beach ball for fun.

Jake: I’ll grab some snacks and water bottles.

Liam: How about we plan a mini relay race while we’re there?

Alex: Great idea! Let’s split into teams and make it competitive.

Mia: Love it. Should we set any rules for the race?

Alex: Keep it simple—each person swims one lap, and we time it.

Jake: Who’s keeping time?

Alex: I’ll bring a stopwatch.

Liam: Are we doing anything after swimming?

Alex: We can grab brunch at the café nearby.

Mia: Perfect! I’ve been wanting to try their pancakes.

Jake: Do we need to reserve the pool, or is it first-come, first-served?

Alex: First-come, first-served, but it’s usually not crowded in the morning.

Liam: Should we warm up before swimming?

Alex: Definitely. Let’s do some stretches by the pool.

Mia: What time should we meet?

Alex: Let’s meet at 8:45 AM so we’re ready when the pool opens.

Jake: Can’t wait. This is going to be so much fun!

Alex: Same here. See you all at 8:45 AM Sunday!
