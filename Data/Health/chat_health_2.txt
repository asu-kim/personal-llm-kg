Alex: Hey Dr. James, I need to schedule a dental check-up. Are there any slots available next week?

Dr. James: Hi Alex, let me check. How about Wednesday at 10 AM?

Alex: I have a meeting at 10 AM on Wednesday. Is there another slot in the afternoon?

Dr. James: Sure, there’s an opening at 3 PM. Does that work?

Alex: Perfect. I’ll take the 3 PM slot. What should I bring to the appointment?

Dr. James: Just your insurance card and any previous dental records if you have them.

Alex: Got it. Is this a routine check-up, or will there be any cleaning involved?

Dr. James: It’s a routine check-up, but we can also do a cleaning if needed.

Alex: Great. How long will the appointment take?

Dr. James: About 30-40 minutes.

Alex: Sounds good. Should I avoid eating before the appointment?

Dr. James: No need, but avoid sugary snacks right before the visit.

Alex: Will you send a reminder closer to the date?

Dr. James: Yes, we’ll send a text reminder a day before the appointment.

Alex: Perfect. Is parking available near the clinic?

Dr. James: Yes, there’s a parking lot right next to the building.

Alex: Thanks! Can I reach out if I need to reschedule?

Dr. James: Of course. Just call or text the clinic.

Alex: Got it. Do you accept my insurance plan?

Dr. James: Yes, we accept it. You’re all set.

Alex: Great. Can we also discuss options for teeth whitening?

Dr. James: Absolutely. We can go over that during your visit.

Alex: Perfect. Thanks for your help, Dr. James!

Dr. James: You’re welcome, Alex. See you on Wednesday at 3 PM!

Alex: See you then!
