Alex: Hey everyone! How about a Secret Santa brunch this Sunday?

Mia: I love the idea! What time are you thinking, Alex?

Alex: Let’s plan for 11 AM. It’ll give everyone enough time to sleep in.

Jake: Works for me. Where should we meet?

Alex: How about the Maple Grove Café? They have a cozy spot perfect for brunch.

Liam: Do we need to bring our Secret Santa gifts to the brunch?

Alex: Yes! Bring your wrapped gifts so we can exchange them after we eat.

Mia: Should we set a price limit for the gifts?

Alex: Let’s keep it around $25.

Jake: Are we revealing who our Secret Santa is?

Alex: Yes, let’s reveal when we exchange the gifts.

Liam: What’s the brunch menu like at the café?

Alex: It’s a mix of breakfast and lunch options—pancakes, omelets, salads, and sandwiches.

Mia: Should we make a reservation?

Alex: Definitely. I’ll book a table for six.

Jake: Is parking available at the café?

Alex: Yes, there’s a small parking lot and street parking nearby.

Liam: Should we dress up for the occasion?

Alex: Semi-casual should be fine, but festive colors would be fun!

Mia: Are we doing any games or activities after brunch?

Alex: Maybe a quick holiday trivia or a group photo before we leave.

Jake: Should we chip in for a tip if the café service is good?

Alex: Yes, let’s all contribute to a nice tip.
