Alex: Hey! I was wondering if you’d like to go out this Friday evening?

Jamie: I’d love to! Do you have something in mind?

Alex: How about dinner at that new Italian place, Bella Vita?

Jamie: Sounds perfect! What time were you thinking?

Alex: How about 7 PM? That way, we can have a relaxed evening.

Jamie: Works for me. Should we make a reservation?

Alex: Yes, I’ll call and book a table for two.

Jamie: Do they have vegetarian options?

Alex: Yes, I checked their menu online. They have great choices for vegetarians.

Jamie: Awesome! Are we doing anything after dinner?

Alex: We could take a walk by the river or grab dessert somewhere.

Jamie: A walk sounds lovely. Should I meet you there or will you pick me up?

Alex: I’ll pick you up at 6:30 PM if that works for you.

Jamie: Perfect. What should I wear?

Alex: It’s a casual but nice place. Something semi-casual would be great.

Jamie: Got it. Should I bring anything?

Alex: Just yourself and a good appetite!

Jamie: Haha, fair enough. Thanks for planning this.

Alex: My pleasure. I’ve been looking forward to this.

Jamie: Same here. Can’t wait for Friday!

Alex: Me too. See you at 6:30!

Jamie: See you then!
