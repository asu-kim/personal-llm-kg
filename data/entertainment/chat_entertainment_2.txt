Alex: Hey guys! Remember how we used to watch “Friends” together as kids?

Joe: Of course! Those were the best times. Who was everyone’s favorite character?

Chloe: Rachel for sure. Her style was iconic!

James: Chandler. His sarcasm was gold.

Alex: I always loved Joey. “How you doin’?” never gets old.

Joe: Haha, classic Joey. Which episode still cracks you up?

Chloe: The one where Ross screams, “We were on a break!”

James: That’s legendary! For me, it’s the Thanksgiving episode with the turkey on Joey’s head.

Alex: Oh yes! Remember when Ross got stuck in his leather pants?

Joe: That was hilarious. What about the emotional moments?

Chloe: Monica and Chandler’s proposal. I still cry every time.

James: Same here. And when Ross and Rachel finally get together in the finale.

Alex: Such a perfect ending. Do you guys think they’d still be together today?

Joe: Definitely. They had their ups and downs, but they’re endgame.

Chloe: Agreed. What about Joey? Do you think he’d settle down?

James: Nah, Joey would still be living his bachelor life in New York.

Alex: Probably! Would you guys ever want a “Friends” reunion?

Joe: 100%. It’d be amazing to see where they all ended up.

Chloe: Absolutely! But only if the original cast is back.

James: Agreed. No one could replace them.

Alex: If we ever visit New York, we have to check out the Central Perk café replica.

Joe: Deal. And we’ll take a picture on the orange couch!

Chloe: It’s a plan. “Friends” will always be the best!

James: Forever!
