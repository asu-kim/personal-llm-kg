Alex: Both! A mix of indie movies, local plays, and some live music events.

Liam: That sounds amazing. What’s the name of your theatre?

Jake: What about refreshments? Are you doing the usual popcorn and soda?

Alex: Yes, but with a twist—artisan popcorn flavors and locally made sodas.

Liam: Nice touch! Are you partnering with local artists for events?

Alex: Definitely. I want the theatre to be a hub for the local art scene.

Mia: Will you host workshops or open mic nights?

Alex: Yes! Workshops, open mic nights, and even Q&A sessions with filmmakers.

Jake: What’s the first show or movie you’re planning to feature?

Alex: A local indie play called Shadows in the Light. It’s fantastic.

Liam: Can we help you with anything before the opening?

Alex: That would be great! I need help spreading the word and decorating the space.

Mia: Count me in. I’ll design some posters for you.

Jake: I’ll handle social media promotions.

Liam: And I’ll bring some fairy lights for the entrance.

Alex: You guys are the best! This theatre is going to be incredible.
