Alex: Hey everyone! How about a hiking trip on December 7th?

Mom: Sounds fun! Morning or afternoon?

Alex: Morning is better. Let’s start by 8 AM.

Dad: Works for me. Where are we going?

Alex: The Woodland Trail. It’s a 3-mile loop with a great picnic spot.

Sister: Perfect! I’ll bring my camera for some winter scenery shots.

Mom: I’ll pack sandwiches and hot soup for the picnic.

Dad: I’ll bring a thermos of coffee and water bottles.

Alex: Great! Should we invite friends too?

Mom: Sure, the more the merrier!

Alex: I’ll ask Max, Adam, Ali, and Ram if they’re interested.

Max: Count me in! What’s the weather forecast?

Alex: Sunny and chilly, around 50°F. Dress warm!

Ali: I’ll bring some energy bars and a first-aid kit.

Adam: I’ll bring a portable stove for some hot drinks at the picnic spot.

Ram: I’ll pack some extra blankets in case it gets too cold.

Sister: Don’t forget gloves and hats, everyone.

Mom: We should carpool to save parking space.

Alex: Good idea. Let’s meet at our house at 7:30 AM and head out together.

Max: Sounds like a plan. This is going to be fun!

Dad: Agreed. See you all on the 7th!

Alex: Can’t wait! Let’s make it a great trip.
