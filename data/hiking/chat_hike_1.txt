Alex: Hey guys! Game night on August 17th is still on, right?  
Mia: Of course! Got some new board games ready too. What time are you all coming?  
Zoe: I'll be there around 8 PM. Snacks duty is mine this time!  
Liam: Great! I’ll bring drinks. Btw, Alex, are you hosting?  
Alex: Yup! My place, as always. Make sure to bring your competitive spirit!  
Zoe: Competitive spirit? 😏 I’m winning this time for sure!  
Mia: Haha, we’ll see. Also, any plans for a movie night soon?  
Alex: Dinner on the 24th could turn into a movie night. Thoughts?  
Liam: Sounds good! But let’s pick something fun, not another mystery thriller, Zoe 😅  
Zoe: Hey, I pick quality films! Fine, we’ll go for comedy this time.  
Mia: Cool. Also, anyone in for the beach day on August 31st?  
Liam: Count me in! Early morning vibes.  
Alex: Same here. Beach volleyball, maybe?  
Zoe: Perfect! I’ll bring sunscreen and a picnic basket.  
Mia: We’re all set then. It’s gonna be so relaxing.  
Alex: Btw, hiking trip on the 10th is still happening, right?  
Liam: Yes! Meeting point at the trailhead by 6 AM. Don’t be late, Alex!  
Alex: Haha, I’ll set 10 alarms this time!  
Mia: Oh, and let’s not forget to take some group photos this time!  
Zoe: Absolutely. This August lineup looks amazing. Can’t wait!
