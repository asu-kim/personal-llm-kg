Alex: Hey family! Who’s up for a squash match this Saturday?

Mom: Sounds fun! What time were you thinking?

Alex: Let’s do it at 3 PM. I’ve booked the court at the community center.

Dad: Perfect timing. Do we have all the equipment we need?

Alex: I have one racket and some squash balls. Does anyone else have rackets?

Sister: I can bring mine, and I think Dad has one too.

Dad: Yup, I’ve got a racket ready to go.

Mom: I’ll come to cheer you all on. Maybe I’ll play a round too!

Alex: Great! Let’s do doubles so everyone gets a chance to play.

Sister: Should we bring snacks and water?

Alex: I’ll pack some water bottles and energy bars.

Mom: I’ll bring some fruit slices for everyone.

Dad: Should we warm up before starting?

Alex: Definitely. We’ll do some stretches and light rallies.

Sister: What’s the plan if someone gets tired?

Alex: We can rotate players or take breaks. It’s all for fun.

Mom: Do we have a backup plan if it rains?

Alex: No worries. The squash court is indoors.

Dad: Good call! This sounds like a great way to spend the afternoon.

Sister: Can’t wait! Let’s make it a family tournament.

Alex: Love the idea! I’ll even keep a score sheet for fun.

Mom: I’m excited. Let’s make it a regular thing if it goes well.

Alex: Absolutely. See you all at 3 PM on Saturday!
